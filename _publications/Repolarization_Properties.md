The present paper investigates the dielectric and repolarization properties of ferroelectric SiO2 – NaNO2 and Al2O3 – NaNO2 composites. It is found that the behavior of the main electrical characteristics is affected by the size of ferroelectric particles and their relative positions in the dielectric matrix.
